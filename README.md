# Global Spotify Hits: Song Popularity Across Different Countries

This project is for **CPRO 2201 - Python Programming II**.  
We analyze a public Spotify Charts dataset using **Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**, then build a **Django + SQLite** web application to present insights such as:

- How popular songs appear across multiple countries.
- Chart diversity per country.
- How long tracks stay on the charts.
- Comparison of global hits vs country-specific hits.

## Tech Stack

- Python (virtual environment)
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Django, SQLite
- Git and GitHub for version control
- VS Code as the main IDE

## Project Structure

- `data/` – Raw and processed Spotify datasets.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploration.
- `analysis/` – Reusable Python scripts for cleaning and analysis.
- `webapp/` – Django project and app for the web interface.
- `docs/` – Report and reference materials.

More details will be added as the project progresses.
